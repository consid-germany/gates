         * - *`readOnly`* - Optional. Can be set to `Equals` a value of `true` or `false` . If you do not add this field, CloudTrail logs both `read` and `write` events. A value of `true` logs only `read` events. A value of `false` logs only `write` events.
         * - *`eventSource`* - For filtering management events only. This can be set to `NotEquals` `kms.amazonaws.com` or `NotEquals` `rdsdata.amazonaws.com` .
         * - *`eventName`* - Can use any operator. You can use it to ﬁlter in or ﬁlter out any data event logged to CloudTrail, such as `PutBucket` or `GetSnapshotBlock` . You can have multiple values for this ﬁeld, separated by commas.
         * - *`eventCategory`* - This is required and must be set to `Equals` .
