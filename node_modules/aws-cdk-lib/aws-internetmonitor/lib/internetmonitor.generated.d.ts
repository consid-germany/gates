/**
 * The `AWS::InternetMonitor::Monitor` resource is an Internet Monitor resource type that contains information about how you create a monitor in Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor.
 *
 * A monitor in Internet Monitor provides visibility into performance and availability between your applications hosted on AWS and your end users, using a traffic profile that it creates based on the application resources that you add: Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), Amazon CloudFront distributions, or WorkSpaces directories.
 *
 * Internet Monitor also alerts you to internet issues that impact your application in the city-networks (geographies and networks) where your end users use it. With Internet Monitor, you can quickly pinpoint the locations and providers that are affected, so that you can address the issue.
 *
 * For more information, see [Using Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-InternetMonitor.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .
